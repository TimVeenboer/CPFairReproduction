# CPFairRecSys
The re-ranking method for a fair recommendation w.r.t both users and items dimension.

## Some Statistics
<img src="./contents/statistics.png" alt="some statistics of the papers" width="350" height="220"/>

## Dataset Prepration
- **ratings_data.txt**: `user-item interactions (raw file)` (by download, from Cornac or another resource)
- **[DatasetName]_data.txt**: This file is a `k-core` file that the users and items ids are mapped to a new range of indecies.

## Datasets
All the datasets used in the experiments are in the `datasets` folder. Each dataset contains several files and a folder including:

- **Folder:**
  - groups: includes two sub-folders, `items` and `users`, in the items folder we have the item groups (`longtail_items.txt` and `shorthead_items.txt`) and in users folder we have two folders (`005` and `020`) each includes two user group files, i.e., `active_ids.txt` and `inactive_ids.txt`.
- **Files:**
  - ratings_data.txt
  - [DatasetName]_data.txt
  - [DatasetName]_inters.txt
  - [DatasetName]_train.txt
  - [DatasetName]_test.txt
  - [DatasetName]_tune.txt

## Model
To run them model you need to run the `fair_model` notebook:
